Q: You have been tasked with writing up the runbook notes to make a schema change to the trade table in the above system. 
The change is to add a new column called seqNum with a long type for the values.

Outline a step-by-step plan to adjust the schema of a table in the above system and describe key points for consideration when modifying processes in the setup.

Points to consider: 
Current feedhandler would keep inserting data with a missing column unless updated

Schema Change Plan:
Have the end of day run and make sure all the data has been saved down to the HDB
Create a backup of the sym file
Update the schema file to add the new column
Update the .d file to reflect the changes like a reordering of the columns, a new column being added or a type change
Add the column to the trade table using the addcol function of dbmaint.q
Add null values to the new column to avoid length error 
Update the feed handler so that data will be inserted into the newly added column
